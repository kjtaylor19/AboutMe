    <p><strong>Kevin Taylor</strong> (born January 19, 1980) is an aspiring photographer with an unique eye. His curiousity for photography started in the early 2000's while taking a class for a graphic design certificate. Throughout this time, Kevin has been learning the technical specifics of his cameras, and discovery his preferences in genres for photography. </p>

    <p>During the Spring of 2014, while venturing through a park, Kevin finally realized what his passion/niche in photography would be...Children!! Specifically speaking toddlers. Kevin has a heart for young children, and realized that he wants to capture the innocence of the child in photo. He realized that capturing such gives opportunity to remind everyone of the child within, and the simplicity of what life can be. He hopes that this will remind everyone in adulthood to find simplicity in life and that life does not have to be so hectic and convoluted. </p>
